<p style="text-align:justify;">The formal writing system in Egyptian hieroglyphics used in Ancient Egypt for writing Egyptian language. Hieroglyphs combine elements of logographic, syllabic, and alphabetic elements, comprising a total of 1,000 different characters. Cursive hieroglyphs were used in religious literature on papyrus and wood. The scripts of later hieratic and demotic Egyptian were derived from hieroglyphics, as was the Proto-Sinaitic script that later evolved into the Phoenician alphabet, which later evolved into the Phoenician alphabet. The main subsystems through the Phoenician alphabet, Greek and Aramaic), Egyptian hieroglyphs were the ancestors of modern use most of the words, the most prominent is the Latin and the Cyrillic scripts by Greek and Arabic, there may be text brahmin family (through the Aramaic, Phoenician, Greek) (Pillai 2021). </p>
 
<p style="text-align:justify;">The use of hieroglyphs stems from the proto-literate symbol systems in the Early Bronze Age, around the 32nd century BC (Naqada III), the first sentence written in the Egyptian language dates from the Second Dynasty (28th century BC). Egyptian hieroglyphics developed into a full-fledged writing system for monumental inscriptions in classical languages of the Middle Kingdom; During that time, the system used about 900 different symbols. The use of this writing system continued into the New Kingdom and late into the Persian and Ptolemaic periods. Late traces of the use of hieroglyphs were found during the Roman period and continued until the 4th century AD. </p>
 
<p style="text-align:justify;">With the final closure of pagan temples in the 5th century, knowledge of hieroglyphics disappeared. Despite attempts, the script remained undeciphered throughout the Middle Ages and early modern period. With the help of the Rosetta Stone, Jean-Francois Champollion finally deciphered the object script in the 1820s. </p>

<h1> 1.History and evolution </h1>

<h2> 1.1 Original: </h2> 

<p style="text-align:justify;">Hieroglyphics originated in an Egyptian art tradition without writing. For example, symbols from Gerzean pottery from 4000 BC are thought to resemble hieroglyphics. </p>
 
<p style="text-align:justify;">The first complete sentence ever found in mature hieroglyphic writing was found on the seal of the Seth-Peribsen tomb at Umm el-qa 'ab, which dates from the Second Dynasty (28th or 27th century BC). About 800 hieroglyphs are known to date back to the Old kingdom, Middle Kingdom and New Kingdom times. </p>
 
<p style="text-align:justify;">Geoffrey Sampson suggests that Egyptian hieroglyphs "appeared some time after and probably were invented under the influence of Sumerian writing" and "may express a written language brought to Egypt from Sumerian Mesopotamia". There are many examples of early Egypt-Mesopotamia relations, but "the origin of ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs has not been determined" due to the lack of direct evidence of text transfer. Others argue that "the evidence for such a direct influence remains flimsy" and that "a very credible argument can also be made for the independent development of The Egyptian script..." Since the 1990s, the above discovery of abydos glyphs between 3400 and 3200 BC has cast doubt on the classical notion that the Mesopotamian system of symbols predates the Egyptian system. However, Egyptian writing popped up around that time, and the evolutionary history of the use of symbols in symbols in Mesopotamia dates back to about 8000 BCE. </p>

<h2> 1.2 Mature writing system: </h2>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Hieroglyphs consist of three kinds of glyphs: phonetic glyphs, including single-consonant characters that function like an alphabet; logographs, representing morphemes; and determinatives, which narrow down the meaning of logographic or phonetic words. </p>
 
<h2> 1.3 Late peroid: </h2>

<p style="text-align:justify;">As writing developed and became more widespread among the Egyptian people, simplified glyph forms developed, resulting in the hieratic (priestly) and demotic (popular) scripts. These variants were also more suited than hieroglyphs for use on papyrus. Hieroglyphic writing was not, however, eclipsed, but existed alongside the other forms, especially in monumental and other formal writing. The Rosetta Stone contains three parallel scripts – hieroglyphic, demotic, and Greek. </p>
 
<h2> 1.4 Late survival: </h2>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Hieroglyphs continued to be used under Persian rule (intermittently in the 6th and 5th centuries BC), after Alexander the Great conquered Egypt, and during the subsequent Ptolemaic and Roman periods. It seems that Greek and Roman writers' comments about hieroglyphs were misleading, at least in part in response to the changing political situation. Some believe that hieroglyphs may have served to distinguish the "real Egyptians" from some foreign conquerors. Another reason may have been the refusal to deal with foreign cultures in their own way, a common Greek and Roman attitude toward Egyptian culture. Understanding that hieroglyphics were sacred writing, Greco-Roman writers imagined this complex but rational system as an allegory, even a magical system, conveying secret, mystical knowledge. 
</p>
 
<p style="text-align:justify;">By the 4th century, few Egyptians could read hieroglyphs, and the myth of allegorical hieroglyphs was in the ascendance. After the Roman emperor Theodosius I closed all non-Christian temples in 391, the monumental use of hieroglyphs ceased; The last known inscriptions are from Philae, graffiti known as Esmet-Akhom. </p>
 
<p style="text-align:justify;">The hieroglyphics of Horapollo (c. 5th century) seem to retain some real knowledge of the writing system. It offers explanations for nearly 200 signs. Some are correctly identified, such as the pictograph of "goose" representing the word "son" (zꜣ). </p>

<h1> 2.Decipherment:</h1>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Knowledge of hieroglyphs was completely lost in the Middle Ages. Early attempts at deciphering were attributed to Hul-Nun al-Misri and Ibn Wahshiyya (9th and 10th centuries respectively). </p>
 
<p style="text-align:justify;">All medieval and early modern attempts were hampered by the basic assumption that hieroglyphs recorded thoughts rather than the sounds of language. Since no bilingual text is available, any such symbolic "translation" can be proposed without verification. It was not until Athanasius Kircher in the mid-17th century that scholars began to think that hieroglyphs might also represent sounds. Kircher was familiar with Coptic and thought it might hold the key to deciphering hieroglyphics, but was hampered by a belief in the mystical nature of the symbols. </p>
 
<p style="text-align:justify;">The breakthrough in decryption and discovery came only to the Rosetta Stone by Napoleon's army in 1799. Because the stone shows both hieroglyphic and popular versions of the same text, along with Greek translations, there is suddenly a wealth of falsifiable translation research material available. In the early 19th century, Sylvester de Sassi, John David Ackblood, Thomas Young and other scholars studied the inscriptions on the stone inscriptions and made some progress. Finally, it was completed by Jean-Francois Champollion in the 1820s. </p>
 

<h1> 3.Writing system:</h1>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Visually, hieroglyphs are more or less figurative: they represent real or abstract elements, sometimes stylized and simplified, but usually fully recognizable in form. Depending on the context, the same symbol can be interpreted in different ways: as a phonetic alphabet (phonetic reading), as a shorthand, or as an ideogram (semagram; "Decisive") (semantic reading) Determinate is not pronounced as a phonetic component, but rather facilitates understanding by distinguishing words from their homophones. </p>

<h1> 4.Spelling: </h1>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Standard orthography—"correct" spelling—in Egyptian is much looser than in modern languages. In fact, one or several variants exist for almost every word. One finds:</p>
4.1 Redundancies;
4.2 Omission of graphemes, which are ignored whether or not they are intentional;
<p style="text-align:justify;">4.3 Substitutions of one grapheme for another, such that it is impossible to distinguish a "mistake" from an "alternate spelling"; </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4.4 Errors of omission in the drawing of signs, which are much more problematic when the writing is cursive (hieratic) writing, but especially demotic, where the schematization of the signs is extreme. </p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"> However, many of these apparent spelling errors constitute an issue of chronology. Spelling and standards varied over time, so the writing of a word during the Old Kingdom might be considerably different during the New Kingdom. Furthermore, the Egyptians were perfectly content to include older orthography ("historical spelling") alongside newer practices, as though it were acceptable in English to use archaic spellings in modern texts. Most often, ancient "spelling errors" are simply misinterpretations of context. Today, hieroglyphics use numerous cataloguing systems (notably the Manuel de Codage and Gardiner's Sign List) to clarify the presence of determinatives, ideograms, and other ambiguous signs in transliteration. </p>
