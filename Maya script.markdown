<p style="text-align:justify;">The Mayans are the only nation in the Americas who have left written records, and thus the script is the only Mesoamerican writing system that has been significantly deciphered. At current, the sound of around 80% of Maya script can be read and about 60% of its meaning can be understood with varying degrees of certainty. The Maya script continued to be used throughout Mesoamerica until the Spanish conquest of the Maya in the 16th and 17th centuries. The Maya script was canlled  'hieroglyphics' or hieroglyphs by early European explorers of the 18th and 19th centuries, who found its general appearance reminiscent of Egyptian hieroglyphs, although the two systems are unrelated. The modern Mayan languages is written almost entirely in the Latin alphabet rather than the Maya script. </p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Maya writing used logograms complemented with a set of syllabic glyphs. It is a combination of hieroglyphs and sounds, and is somewhat similar in function to modern Japanese writing. Some signs called logograms in Maya script represent words or ideas, while other signs called syllabograms (or phonograms) represent sounds in the form of single syllables. The glyphs used as syllabograms were originally logograms for single-syllable words, usually those that ended in a vowel or weak consonant, such as y, w, h or glottal stop. These syllabic glyphs had two main functions: 1) as phonetic complements to disambiguate logograms which had multiple reading; 2) and to enable the writing of grammatical elements. An individual Maya glyph or symbol could represent either a morpheme or a syllable, and the same glyph could often be used for both. Because of these dual readings, it is customary to capitalize all logographic readings and to write phonetic readings in italics or bold. Words in Maya script are composed of several signs aoosiciated together. The group of signs that make up a word is called a ‘glyph block’, and the largest part within a glyph block is called the ‘main sign’ while the smaller parts attached to it are called ‘affixes’. </p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">The general reading rule for Maya script is to read the signs in a given glyph block from left to right and from top to bottom. Similarly, Maya texts are written and read from left to right and from top to bottom, usually in columns of two glyph blocks. </p>


<p style="text-align:justify;">Maya hieroglyphs were carved on stone monuments and walls of temples and burial chambers, or carved into jade and shells, or written (or depicted) on pottery, the inner bark of banyan trees and tanned deerskin with a hairbrush similar to the Chinese style brush. These contents include the Mayan religious myths, prayers, history, astronomy and calendars. Most of the texts found by archeologists are from inscriptions that mainly record the deeds of the kings and the history of their dynasty. Their purpose is not to give precepts or to sing the praises of the royal family, but to chronicle the events. Therefore, dates are very important, and they take up most of the space (up to 80%) of the monument's inscriptions. </p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Two different ways of writing the word bʼalam "jaguar" in the Maya script. First as logogram representing the entire word with the single glyph bʼalam, then phonetically using the three syllable signs bʼa, la, and ma. </p>
