<p style="text-align:justify;">Chinese characters are one of the oldest systems of writing in the world. They are widely used in East Asia now, as well as historically used by the Sinosphere. Chinese characters are the only logographic writing systems that are still widely used and highly developed in the world. With the exception of very few Chinese characters, each Chinese character corresponds to one syllable. The evolution of Chinese characters has gone through the stages of oracle bone script, bronze inscriptions, seal script, clerical script, regular script, cursive script and semi-cursive script. At current, regular script is widely used in writing and application. </p>

<h1> Evolution process of Chinese characters </h1>

<h1> 1 Oracle bone script </h1>

<p style="text-align:justify;">The oracle bone script is the earliest known form of Chinese writing. It refers mainly to the writing carved on turtle plastrons or animal bones used in pyromantic divination by the royal family of the late Shang dynasty (the late 2nd millennium BC) in China. The emperors of the Shang dynasty used oracle bones for divination to predict the fortune of events, and then carved the information about the divination (such as the time and content of the divination, the diviner, the result of the divination, and the verification of the result of the divination) on the oracle bones, These oracle bones were kept as archival material by the royal historians. </p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Oracle bone script was first discovered at the Yinxu site located in Xiaotun village, Anyang city, Henan province, China. More than 150,000 oracle bone pieces and 4,500 individual characters have been excavated. Oracle bone script has a symmetrical and stable structure. Despite its pictorial nature, oracle bone script has developed into a more systematic and fully functional script in terms of the number and structure of scripts. These oracle bone pieces are also extremely rich in content, covering many aspects of social situations in Shang dynasty. It generally deals with a wide range of topics between 10 and 100 characters, including astronomy, war, agriculture, religion, births and deaths in the royal family, etc. </p>

<h1> 2 Bronze inscriptions </h1>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Bronze inscriptions are one of earliest Chinese writing scripts, preceded by the oracle bone inscriptions. Bronze inscriptions refer to inscriptions that appeared on ritual bronzes from the Shang dynasty (2nd millennium BC) to the Zhou dynasty (11th-3rd century BC). In ancient times, Chinese people used inscribed vessels for sacrificial feasts to honor and appease ancestral spirits. The Shang dynasty was in the initial stages of Bronze inscriptions, although bronze vessels were already present during this period, there were not many of them with bronze inscriptions until the Zhou dynasty. Early bronze inscriptions were always cast with a stylus in the wet clay of the bronze piece-mold and then cast the bronze. However, later inscriptions were usually engraved after the bronze was cast. </p> 

<p style="text-align:justify;">The bronze inscriptions retain some writing styles of the oracle bones scripts, while further reducing the number of strokes and standardizing the writing style. Unlike the oracle bone inscriptions, which are characterized by thin and straight strokes, the bronze inscriptions are wide and thick, with many curved strokes and clusters. The inscriptions on the bronze vessels, with varying numbers of characters, are richer in content than the oracle bone pieces. They reflect the social life of the time, mostly celebrating the achievements of ancestors, emperors and nobility, as well as recording significant historical events. At current,  a total of 372 characters have been found, and 2,420 can be identified.</p>

<h1> 3 Seal script </h1>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Seal script was common throughout the latter half of the 1st millennium BC. It developed from the bronze inscriptions in the Zhou Dynasty. Seal script is mainly  divided into two types of script: the Large Seal Script and the Small Seal Script. The concept of the Large Seal Script is ambiguous and can cover a wide range of scripts (including a variation of Qin writing earlier than the small seal characters, the earlier Western Zhou forms, or even oracle bone characters as well), while after the unification of China by the first emperor of Qin dynasty - Qin Shi Huangdi, the Qin variant of seal script, known as the Small Seal Script, eventually became the standard and was adopted as the official script of China. Therefore, in the absence of any other clarifying terminology, the term ‘seal script’ refers to the Small Seal Script. </p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">The strokes of the Small Seal Script are horizontal and vertical, uniform in thickness. The strokes also have smooth turning. The character as a whole has a rectangular symmetrical structure with a tight top and a loose bottom. Due to its intricate strokes and smooth, graceful shape, it has high artistic value. The Small Seal Script was still widely used for decorative carvings and seals until the Han Dynasty (202 BC – 220 AD). When the Chinese writing systems reached the stage of the Small Seal Script, the outline of the script and the structure of the strokes gradually began to take shape. The pictorial nature of the Small Seal Script weakened, making characters more symbolic and less confusing to write and read. The use of the Small Seal Script in the Qin dynasty unified the national script and essentially eliminated the phenomenon of different scripts in different parts of the country, playing an important role in the history of Chinese writing.</p>

<h1> 4 Clerical script </h1>

<p style="text-align:justify;">The script was first created in the Qin Dynasty, was dominated in the Han Dynasty and continued to be used through the Wei-Jin periods. It was developed from the Seal Script. Seal script, with its complex structure and strokes, is not suitable for composing long documents or for writing at speed. The circular and balanced stroke form of the Seal Script was replaced by a standardized, angular stroke form in the clerical script. Thus the clerical script, as a writing system that did not require much time and effort to balance curves and symmetries, developed rapidly. The character of the clerical script tends to be wide and flat, with long horizontal strokes and short vertical strokes. Most notable characteristic of clerical script is the dramatically flared tail of one dominant horizontal or downward-diagonal stroke, especially that to the lower right. Because of this distinctive shape, the strokes are called 'silkworm head and wild goose tail'. Due to its high legibility for modern East Asian person, it is still used today in situations where decorative text is required, such as headlines, signage and advertisements.</p>

<h1> 5 Regular script </h1>

<p style="text-align:justify;">The Regular Script evolved from the Clerical Script, and its structure and strokes became more simplified. It emerged in China between the Han Dynasty and the Three Kingdoms period, gained dominance in the Southern and Northern Dynasties, and matured in the Tang Dynasty. It is also the most common style of modern Chinese writing and is the first script encountered by beginners of Chinese calligraphy. As its name implies, the Regular Script is regular, with each stroke placed slowly and carefully on the paper. The structure of the Regular Script is rigorous, with square shapes and straight strokes. There are no links between the structures of characters, and each stroke is independent. As a result, the script as a whole looks very regular and gives a stable and dignified visual experience. </p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">The four great calligraphers of the early Tang - Ouyang Xun, Yu Shinan, Chu Suiliang and Xue Ji - were all known for their regular script. Depending on the size of the characters, the Regular Script is further divided into larger regular script , medium regular script and small regular script. Regular characters with a width (or length) larger than 5 cm are usually considered larger regular script, while those smaller than 2 cm are usually called small regular script. Those in between is the medium regular script.</p>

<h1> 6 Cursive script </h1>

<p style="text-align:justify;">The cursive script was formed in the Han Dynasty. It evolved from the clerical script for ease of writing. The cursive script modifies, merges or even eliminates the strokes of Chinese characters, so that it can be written faster than any other Chinese script. However, it is difficult to read for those who are not familiar with its writing structure. It is used mainly as a shorthand or calligraphic style. People who can read Chinese in its standard or printed form may not be able to read cursive script, therefore, it cannot replace clerical script as the dominant script in the same way as regular script. The characters in cursive possess an abstract appearance and the characters frequently flow into one another. The characters are highly rounded and soft in appearance, lacking obvious angular lines. Cursive script is intended to feel graceful in a frenetic way. The cursive script places more importance on its artistry and the expression of the calligrapher's emotions than on readability. The calligrapher Huai Su's work - Huai Su’s Autobiography is one of the most representative works of cursive script.</p>

<h1> 7 Semi-cursive script </h1>

<p style="text-align:justify;">The Semi-cursive Script emerged in the Han Dynasty and was developed on the basis of the Regular Script. It is a writing system between regular script and cursive script, created to compensate for the slow writing speed of regular script and the illegibility of cursive script. The cursive script is slightly abbreviated where the strokes of characters can be visibly connected in writing, but not to the extent of the cursive script. This script ensures artistry while being readable and practical. There is a relative freedom of creation in the structure of the semi-cursive script characters, allowing the calligrapher to adjust the size of the script and the thickness of the strokes at his own discretion. Semi-cursive script’s ultimate aim is seeking harmony in the overall match of each character. Another characteristic of semi-cursive script is the connection of successive strokes, requiring a character to be written in an uninterrupted manner. One of the most famous Chinese calligraphers - Wang Xizhi - is famous for his work in semi-structure script - Preface to the Orchid Pavilion Collection.</p>
