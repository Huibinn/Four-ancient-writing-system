<p style="text-align:justify;"> The origins of writing appear during the start of the pottery phase of the Neolithic, when clay tokens were used to record specific amounts of livestock or commodities. These tokens were initially impressed on the surface of round clay envelopes and then stored in them. The tokens were then progressively replaced by flat tablets, on which signs were recorded with a stylus. Actual writing is first recorded in Uruk, at the end of the 4th millennium BC, and soon after in various parts of the Near-East. </p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"> The cuneiform script underwent considerable changes over a period of more than two millennia. The image below shows the development of the sign SAƒú "head". </p>

<h1> 1.Late Uruk Ôºàcirca 3500BC‚Äì2900BCÔºâ</h1>

<p style="text-align:justify;"> The cuneiform script was developed from pictographic proto-writing in the late 4th millennium BC, stemming from the near eastern token system used for accounting. These tokens were in use from the 9th millennium BC and remained in occasional use even late in the 2nd millennium BC.Early tokens with pictographic shapes of animals, associated with numbers, were discovered in Tell Brak, and date to the mid-4th millennium BC. </p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"> Around 3500 BC, the Sumerians of the Bronze Age used clay tablets and clay balls to record accounts in the form of pictures and engravings. Most proto-cuneiform records from this period were of an accounting nature. The writing about 3100 years ago became the embryonic form of later cuneiform writing. It is difficult to understand the primitive writings of the Uruk period, but people at that time had already begun to accumulate complex language. The cuneiform script at that time contained a categorized vocabulary, which unified various symbols, words and phrases according to certain standards, and then divided them into plants, human settlements, cities, tools, metals, and animals according to themes. </p>

<h1> 2.Early Dynastic cuneiform Ôºàcirca 2900BC‚Äì2350BCÔºâ</h1>

<p style="text-align:justify;"> The cuneiform writing in the early dynasty period was more widely used than the writing in the Uruk period, and most of the cities in the Mesopotamia have found clay tablets from this era. It was the Sumerians who pioneered writing in the true sense during this period. They also invented the royal script and began to write cuneiform writing on stone bowls and scepters. In the Farah period, in 2600 BC, the wedge-shaped stylus replaced the pictographic round stylus, each with a triangle. Gradually, these symbols evolved into ideographic symbols, and those that could not be described were expressed in arbitrary ways. Moreover, the Sumerians also used it to express sounds. Several ideographic characters together can represent a complex word or phrase, which makes many symbols redundant.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"> Around 2500 BC, Sumerian had developed into a syllable syllable writing. Simultaneous words often use one character together. A symbol can also represent a sound, and pronunciation symbols are used instead of ideographic symbols. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> In the earliest records of Sumer, there were about 2,000 symbols used, but after more than 600 years of improvement, the number of symbols had been reduced to about 600 by about 2900 BC. The symbol is further simplified, and finally evolved into a combination of wedge-shaped notches. There are four basic strokes: horizontal, vertical, oblique and folded. This is cuneiform writing. At first, the cuneiform writing was written straight from top to bottom, and then it was written horizontally from left to right. The glyph also changed from sitting upright to lying down, turning 90 degrees. </p>

<h2> 2.1Syllable changes </h2>

<p style="text-align:justify;"> The script was also widely used on commemorative stelae and carved reliefs to record the achievements of the ruler in whose honor the monument had been erected. The spoken language included many homophones and near-homophones, and in the beginning, similar-sounding words such as "life" [til] and "arrow" [ti] were written with the same symbol. After the Semites conquered Southern Mesopotamia, some signs gradually changed from being pictograms to syllabograms, most likely to make things clearer in writing. In that way, the sign for the word "arrow" would become the sign for the sound "ti". </p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"> Words that sounded alike would have different signs; for instance, the syllable […°u] had fourteen different symbols. When the words had a similar meaning but very different sounds they were written with the same symbol. For instance 'tooth' [zu], 'mouth' [ka] and 'voice' [gu] were all written with the symbol for "voice". To be more accurate, scribes started adding to signs or combining two signs to define the meaning. They used either geometrical patterns or another cuneiform sign. </p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"> As time went by, the cuneiform got very complex and the distinction between a pictogram and syllabogram became vague. Several symbols had too many meanings to permit clarity. Therefore, symbols were put together to indicate both the sound and the meaning of a compound. The word 'raven' [UGA] had the same logogram as the word 'soap' [NAGA], the name of a city [ERE≈†], and the patron goddess of Eresh [NISABA]. Two phonetic complements were used to define the word [u] in front of the symbol and [gu] behind. Finally, the symbol for 'bird' [MU≈†EN] was added to ensure proper interpretation. </p>

<h1> 3.Ancient Akkadian EmpireÔºà2234BC‚Äì 2154BCÔºâ---Third Dynasty of Ur Ôºà2112BC--2004BCÔºâ</h1>

<p style="text-align:justify;"> The archaic cuneiform script was adopted by the Akkadian Empire from the 23rd century BC (short chronology). The Akkadian language being Semitic, its structure was completely different from Sumerian. There was no way to use the Sumerian writing system as such, and the Akkadians found a practical solution in writing their language phonetically, using the corresponding Sumerian phonetic signs. The Akkadians also compiled bilingual dictionaries in Sumerian and Akkadian. They also carried out transformation and development on the basis of absorbing Sumerian language and writing, and established a relatively complete cuneiform writing system. Still, some of the Sumerian characters were retained for their pictorial value as well: for example the character for "sheep" was retained, but was now pronounced immer≈´, rather than the Sumerian "udu-me≈°". </p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"> The Semitic languages employed equivalents for many signs that were distorted or abbreviated to represent new values because the syllabic nature of the script as refined by the Sumerians was not intuitive to Semitic speakers. From the beginning of the Middle Bronze Age (20th century BC), the script evolved to accommodate the various dialects of Akkadian: Old Akkadian, Babylonian and Assyrian. In particular, the Old Assyrian cuneiform employed many modifications to Sumerian orthography. </p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"> Later, the Babylonians and Assyrians improved from the Akkadian basis and became the later Babylonian dialects in the South and the Assyrian dialects in the North. During the third dynasty of Ur, an important document in the history of Mesopotamia was born, and the Sumerian King List was born. The first law of Sumer, the Code of Urnam, was also customized in this period.</p>

These are some of the more important signs: the complete Sumero-Akkadian list of characters actually numbers about 600, with many more "values", or pronunciation possibilities. </p>


<h2> 3.1 The signs exemplary of these basic wedges </h2> 

<p style="text-align:justify;"> At this stage, the former pictograms were reduced to a high level of abstraction, and were composed of only five basic wedge shapes: horizontal, vertical, two diagonals and the Winkelhaken impressed vertically by the tip of the stylus. </p>

A≈† (B001, U+12038) íÄ∏: horizontal;

DI≈† (B748, U+12079) íÅπ: vertical;

GE23, DI≈† ten√ª (B575, U+12039) íÄπ: downward diagonal;

GE22 (B647, U+1203A) íÄ∫: upward diagonal;

U (B661, U+1230B) íåã: the Winkelhaken.

<p style="text-align:justify;"> Except for the Winkelhaken, which has no tail, the length of the wedges' tails could vary as required for sign composition. Signs tilted by about 45 degrees are called ten√ª in Akkadian, thus DI≈† is a vertical wedge and DI≈† ten√ª a diagonal one. If a sign is modified with additional wedges, this is called gun√ª or "gunification"; if signs are cross-hatched with additional Winkelhaken, they are called ≈°e≈°ig; if signs are modified by the removal of a wedge or wedges, they are called nutillu. </p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"> "Typical" signs have about five to ten wedges, while complex ligatures can consist of twenty or more (although it is not always clear if a ligature should be considered a single sign or two collated, but distinct signs); the ligature KAxGUR7 consists of 31 strokes. </p>


<h1> 4.Ising Larsa and Babylonian period (2107BC‚Äì1595BC) </h1>

<p style="text-align:justify;"> This is the glorious period of Sumerian language and literature, during which a large number of myths, epics, fables, and royal hymns appeared. In the 18th century BC, the Babylonian era and the Assyrian era from the 9th century to the 7th century BC used cuneiform writing. One of the more famous is the Code of Hammurabi. In Babylon, cuneiform writing has transitioned from evolving to sounding, from pictograms to abstract concepts related to objects, and from expressing objects or concepts to expressing certain sounds that deviate from the original intent. At this time, there are more than 640 cuneiform scripts of Babylon, which are more simplified and more advanced than the Sumerian. In the early days, there were fewer unearthed documents in the north compared with the abundant information in the south. However, judging from the clay tablets of ancient Assyrian merchants unearthed in Turkey, they also simplified the cuneiform writing at the time, which may have promoted the popularization of the writing. </p>

The Babylonian king Hammurabi still used vertical cuneiform circa 1750 BC.

<h1> 5.Middle Babylonian or Cassitian period Ôºàcirca 1600BC‚Äì1155BCÔºâ</h1>

<p style="text-align:justify;"> During the Babylonian and Assyrian rule, cuneiform writing had a greater development, the calligraphy was exquisite and the vocabulary was expanded and complete, which made other ethnic groups in Mesopotamia also adopted this type of writing. Judging from the Amarna documents unearthed in Egypt, around 1500 BC, the major countries in this region, such as Egypt, Hittite, Mitanni, Eland, Cassit Babylon, and Mid-Assyria, did not try to change the local area. Akkadian and cuneiform writing, and Akkadian written in cuneiform became the diplomatic language of the time. In the late 2nd century BC, the King‚Äôs Library of Central Assyria unearthed a wealth of records, including various administrative archives from Assyria and Babylon; there are not many literary remains of the Cassites, but they creatively used cuneiform writing In economic management, the method known as "kudurru"; these materials bring comprehensive information to scholars‚Äô research. </p>



<h1> 6.Assyrian cuneiform </h1>

<p style="text-align:justify;"> This "mixed" method of writing continued through the end of the Babylonian and Assyrian empires, although there were periods when "purism" was in fashion and there was a more marked tendency to spell out the words laboriously, in preference to using signs with a phonetic complement. Yet even in those days, the Babylonian syllabary remained a mixture of logographic and phonemic writing. After that, the Assyrian cuneiform, the vocabulary was expanded, and the calligraphy became more exquisite. At this time, there were 570 cuneiform scripts used by the Assyrians, of which 300 were commonly used characters. Later Assyrian cuneiform script actually gradually evolved into syllable script. </p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"> Simplified cuneiform syllabary, in use during the Neo-Assyrian period.The "C" before and after vowels stands for "Consonant" </p>


<p style="text-align:justify;"> Hittite cuneiform is an adaptation of the Old Assyrian cuneiform of c. 1800 BC to the Hittite language. When the cuneiform script was adapted to writing Hittite, a layer of Akkadian logographic spellings was added to the script, thus the pronunciations of many Hittite words which were conventionally written by logograms are now unknown. </p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"> In the Iron Age (c. 10th to 6th centuries BC), Assyrian cuneiform was further simplified. The characters remained the same as those of Sumero-Akkadian cuneiforms, but the graphic design of each character relied more heavily on wedges and square angles, making them significantly more abstract.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"> From the 6th century, the Akkadian language was marginalized by Aramaic, written in the Aramaean alphabet, but Neo-Assyrian cuneiform remained in use in the literary tradition well into the times of the Parthian Empire (250 BC‚Äì226 AD).The last known cuneiform inscription, an astronomical text, was written in 75 AD.The ability to read cuneiform may have persisted until the third century AD.</p>

<h1> 7.New Babylonian period (625 BC-539 BC) and later period </h1>

<p style="text-align:justify;"> After the fall of Nineveh, in the new Babylonian kingdom established by the Chaldeans, cuneiform writing was still used among the royal family and the people. In 539 BC, after Persia conquered the Kingdom of Babylon, he also learned cuneiform writing from the latter. Due to the huge territory of the Persian Empire, the Persians in the Iranian Plateau changed the Mesopotamian cuneiform writing to the more convenient alphabetic writing due to the needs of commercial development. At the beginning of the millennium BC, the Alamian language appeared as an annotation on the cuneiform clay tablet. After the millennium BC, Alamea gradually replaced Akkadian as the international language of the region. Later, it was first replaced by Greek and then by Arabic. It wasn't until 1000 BC that Phoenician merchants invented the Phoenician alphabet based on Egyptian hieroglyphics. From then on, the alphabetic writing entered the stage of history and gradually became the mainstream of the West. Cuneiform writing has been popular in West Asia for three thousand years. The last cuneiform tablet found today is a relic from AD 75. Since then, no one knows the cuneiform writing. </p>
